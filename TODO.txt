Task List:
1. Figure out what readings are needed from the 10-k
2. Locate location of readings in documents
    - Determine if getValues() will work on these.
3. Create one streamlines method of storing all the obtained values.
    - Could use pandas? could save as one big array (cpu and memory probably not great).
4. See how well algo works on other tickers.
    - Naming convention could differ
5. Push to google sheets.

Notes:
Efficiency is not great right now as the algorithm parses through the entire file rather than a focused region.

Completed:
